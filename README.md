# GAIAShellScripting

This shell script is designed to automate the process of updating Dockerfile images within a specific Git repository and branch. It performs several key operations, including navigating to the repository directory, selecting a branch, updating the Dockerfile, and then committing and pushing these changes.

Initially, the script defines two variables: BASE_REPO_DIR, which specifies the base directory of the repository, and OUTPUT_FILE, which is the path to a log file where the script's output will be redirected. This setup ensures that all operations and their outcomes are logged, providing a clear record of the script's actions.

The navigate_to_repo function attempts to change the current directory to the one specified by BASE_REPO_DIR. If the directory does not exist, it logs an error message and exits. Additionally, it checks if there is exactly one subdirectory named "profile-service" and navigates into it if present. This step is crucial for ensuring that the script operates in the correct directory context.

The select_branch function is responsible for switching to a specific Git branch, in this case, feature/develop-ffv2. It first cleans up any stale references to remote branches, then fetches all branches from the remote. It checks if the desired branch exists remotely and locally, handling each case by either checking out and pulling the branch or creating and checking out a new branch based on the remote. This ensures that the script is working with the latest version of the branch.

The update_dockerfile function searches for specific base images within the Dockerfile and replaces them with new image paths. It uses grep to find lines matching the old image paths and sed to perform in-place substitutions with the new paths. After updating the Dockerfile, it creates a new branch, commits the changes, and attempts to push them to the remote repository. If the initial push fails, it sets the upstream branch and tries again. This function encapsulates the core functionality of the script, updating the Dockerfile with new, presumably more secure or efficient, base images.

Finally, the script executes these functions in sequence and redirects all output, including any errors, to the specified log file. This approach ensures that the script's operations are atomic and that any issues can be easily traced and resolved.
